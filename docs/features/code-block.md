# Code Blocks

One big reason that led to the creation of Slidev was the need to perfectly display code in slides. Consequently, you can use Markdown-flavored code blocks to highlight your code.

````md
```ts
console.log('Hello, World!')
```
````

Slidev has [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) built in as the syntax highlighter. Refer to [Configure Shiki](/custom/highlighters) for more details.
