# Theme and Addons

A slides project can have one theme and multiple addons. All of them can provide styles, components, layouts and other configs to your slides project.

## Use a Theme

Changing the theme in Slidev is surprisingly easy. All you need to do is to add the `theme` option in your [headmatter](../custom/index#headmatter):

```md
---
theme: seriph
---

# The first slide
```

::: info Theme name convention

- You can also pass a relative or absolute path to a local theme folder, like `../my-theme`
- You can always use the full package name as the theme name
- If the theme is built-in or is named like `slidev-theme-name`, you can omit the `slidev-theme-` prefix
- For scoped packages like `@org/slidev-theme-name`, the full package name is required

:::

You can start the server, and will be prompted to install the theme after a confirm.

<div class="language-md text-xs pl-6">
<pre style="overflow: hidden; text-wrap: pretty;">
<span class="token keyword">?</span> The theme <span class="token string">"@slidev/theme-seriph"</span> was not found in your project, do you want to install it now? â€º (Y/n)
</pre>
</div>

or install the theme manually via:

```bash
$ npm install @slidev/theme-seriph
```

And that's all, enjoy the new theme! For more details about the usage, you can refer to the theme's README.

## Eject Theme

If you want to get full control of the current theme, you can **eject** it to your local file system and modify it as you want. By running the following command

```bash
$ slidev theme eject
```

It will eject the theme you are using currently into `./theme`, and change your frontmatter to

```yaml
---
theme: ./theme
---
```

This could also be helpful if you want to make a theme based on an existing one. If you do, remember to mention the original theme and the author :)

## Local Theme

As you probably found out from the previous section, you can have a local theme for your project. By having a **relative path** in your theme field.

```yaml
---
theme: ./path/to/theme
---
```

Refer to [how to write a theme](/themes/write-a-theme) for more details.
